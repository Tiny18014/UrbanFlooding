    "# METHOD 1: Markov Chain Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "## OBJECTIVE: Build a probabilistic Markov Chain model for urban flood prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "### TASK DESCRIPTION:\n",
    "Implement a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or Markov Chain approach that:\n",
    "1. Discretizes water levels into states (bins)\n",
    "2. Learns transition probabilities between states\n",
    "3. Uses rainfall as observation/forcing signal\n",
    "4. Predicts future water level states autoregressively\n",
    "\n",
    "### REQUIREMENTS:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. STATE DISCRETIZATION:\n",
    "   - Bin water levels into K states (e.g., K=20-50 bins)\n",
    "   - Use quantile-based binning for balanced state distribution\n",
    "   - Create separate state spaces for 1D and 2D nodes\n",
    "   - Handle Model 1 (300m scale) and Model 2 (40m scale) separately\n",
    "\n",
    "2. TRANSITION MATRIX LEARNING:\n",
    "   For each node:\n",
    "   - Compute P(state_t+1 | state_t, rainfall_t)\n",
    "   - Use all training events to estimate probabilities\n",
    "   - Consider rainfall-conditional transitions:\n",
    "     * Low rain: P_low(s_t+1 | s_t)\n",
    "     * Medium rain: P_med(s_t+1 | s_t)\n",
    "     * High rain: P_high(s_t+1 | s_t)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. SPATIAL COUPLING:\n",
    "   - For 2D nodes: Include neighbor states in transition probability\n",
    "     P(s_i,t+1 | s_i,t, s_neighbors,t, rainfall_t)\n",
    "   - For 1D nodes: Include upstream pipe states\n",
    "   - Use 1D-2D connections for cross-layer influence\n",
    "\n",
    "4. PREDICTION MECHANISM:\n",
    "   - Given initial state and rainfall forecast\n",
    "   - Autoregressively sample/predict most likely state sequence\n",
    "   - Convert final state bins back to continuous water levels\n",
    "   - Use state bin centers or Gaussian smoothing\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ADVANCED FEATURES:\n",
    "   - Higher-order Markov: P(s_t+1 | s_t, s_t-1, s_t-2)\n",
    "   - Rainfall history features: cumulative rain, peak intensity\n",
    "   - Time-varying transitions for different event phases (rise vs recession)\n",
    "\n",
    "### IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Data Preparation (30 min)\n",
    "- Load all training events\n",
    "- Discretize water levels into states using quantiles\n",
    "- Create rainfall bins (low/med/high) based on intensity\n",
    "- Extract temporal sequences: [state_t, state_t+1, rainfall_t]\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Transition Matrix Estimation (1 hour)\n",
    "- For each node:\n",
    "  * Count transitions: C(s_i → s_j | rainfall_bin)\n",
    "  * Normalize to probabilities: P = C / sum(C)\n",
    "  * Add Laplace smoothing for unseen transitions\n",
    "- Store matrices: transition_probs[node_idx][rainfall_bin]\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Spatial Extension (1 hour)\n",
    "- For each 2D node, identify neighbors from edge_index\n",
    "- Compute joint transition: P(s_i,t+1 | s_i,t, avg(s_neighbors,t))\n",
    "- For 1D nodes, use upstream connectivity\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Prediction (30 min)\n",
    "- Initialize with ground truth state at t=0\n",
    "- Loop for each timestep:\n",
    "  * Look up current state and rainfall bin\n",
    "  * Sample next state from P(s_t+1 | s_t, rainfall)\n",
    "  * OR use argmax for deterministic prediction\n",
    "- Convert state sequence back to water levels\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: Evaluation (30 min)\n",
    "- Compute Standardized RMSE using competition metric\n",
    "- Analyze where Markov chain fails (likely: extreme events)\n",
    "- Compare to persistence baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "### EXPECTED PERFORMANCE:\n",
    "- Baseline: 0.1128\n",
    "- Markov Chain Target: 0.08-0.10 (10-30% improvement)\n",
    "- Strengths: Captures statistical patterns, fast inference\n",
    "- Weaknesses: Discretization loss, limited memory, no complex spatial reasoning\n",
    "\n",
